<h1>Testing Web Apps for Vulnerabilities</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this vulnerability test, I will test three web applications and determine whether each application is vulnerable. For each vulnerability I will provide the following:

- A walkthrough explaining how the application is intended to work.
- An explanation of the test I will be conducting against the application for vulnerabilities.
- And a mitigation solution. 

Topics Covered:
- Command Injection
- Brute force attacks
- Burp Suite
- Directory traversal
- Dot-dot-slash attacks
- BeEF
- Cross-site scripting


<h2>Scenario</h2>
I'm an Application Security Engineer for the bioengineering company, Replicants. Replicants have created several new web applications and would like me to test them for vulnerabilities. Additionally, my manager would like me to test a tool called <i><b>BeEF</b></i> in order to understand the impact it could have on the organization if Replicants were targeted with this tool.
